<h2>the Insider - Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    The 'the Insider' services and mobile app (collectively, the “Services”) offer users a forum to interact with other
    'the Insider' users in the same organization, in order to post and share comments, and to respond to comments posted
    by others. In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we
    obtain about users of
    our Services, which are available via mobile applications offered in the Apple and Android app stores. Your use of
    our Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Service, including its
    applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes, which is available at
    [http://www.theinsider.cc/Privacy.html] and incorporated by reference into this Policy.
</p>


<h3>Invite Contacts</h3>

<p>You can choose to “Share the Insider” by inviting contacts via email, text or other means. You choose what contacts
    to invite and when to invite them. If you invite a contact, we will generate a message with the 'the Insider'
    download URL included, which you can choose to send via your mobile device.</p>

<h3>Your Posts</h3>

<p>You can delete content you have posted (including replies). Content you delete will be hidden from other users.
    However,
    'the Insider' may maintain a copy of such content in our records. </p>

<h3>Push Notifications/Alerts</h3>

<p>We may send push notifications or alerts to your device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing
    the
    notification settings on your device or by changing your 'the Insider' settings. </p>

<h3>Third Party Analytics</h3>

<p>We may use automated devices and applications, included those offered by third parties to evaluate usage of our
    Services. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our
    Services, performance and user experiences. We do not share your personal information with these third parties. </p>

<h3>Third Party Ads </h3>

<p>We may display ads to you (including in-app ads), and we may target those ads based on your location, your 'the
    Insider'
    activities, and other criteria (e.g., the time of day).</p>

<h3>Third-Party Links </h3>

<p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed
    by
    this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. </p>

<h3>Minors </h3>

<p>You must be at least 17 to use our Services. Our Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that
    a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems. </p>

<h3>Contact Us </h3>

<p>If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our Services or would like to make a complaint, please contact us
    at [support@theinsider.cc].</p>

<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>

<p>
    This Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above. We may change this Policy from time to time, so
    please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Policy on our Site, at
    [http://www.theinsider.cc/Privacy.html]. If we make any changes to this Policy that materially affect our practices
    with regard to the personal information we have previously collected from you, we will endeavor to provide you with
    notice in advance of such change by highlighting the change on our Site, or providing notice in our mobile app.</p>
